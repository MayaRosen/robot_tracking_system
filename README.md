# ü§ñ Robot Tracking System

This project is a robotics application developed to allow a **Unitree robot** to follow a person using **UWB (Ultra-Wideband)** tracking. The goal is to create an autonomous robot that can track and follow a person in real time, ensuring it maintains an appropriate distance and avoids obstacles in its path. The project is conducted under the guidance of **Professor David Sarne**.

## üìú Background

This project was created with the aim of helping **elderly individuals** by providing them with companionship through autonomous technology. The robot is designed to **follow elderly users** to reduce feelings of loneliness and enhance **social interaction**. This project is also being developed in collaboration with the **Department of Social Work**, aiming to improve the **quality of life for elderly people** by integrating technology into daily routines, offering both physical and social support.

The **Unitree robot** has been integrated with **UWB tracking technology**, allowing the robot to track and follow individuals based on **yaw**, **distance**, and **orientation**. These capabilities enable the robot to assist in a variety of scenarios, whether indoors or in controlled environments.

### **Current Progress:**
- Developed a **side-by-side walking system** for the **Unitree Go2 robot**, using sensor data for **dynamic positioning** and custom algorithms to enhance spatial estimation, control logic, and tracking performance. The robot can **follow a person**, moving **forward and backward**, and **turning** based on the person‚Äôs changing position.
- **Obstacle avoidance** is integrated, ensuring the robot can safely navigate through its environment.

### **Future Plans:**
- **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**:  
  A major goal for future development is to incorporate **human-robot interaction** (HRI). The robot will be capable of responding to **vocal commands** and **gestures**, enhancing how users can interact with it. This feature will make the robot more intuitive, allowing it to react to commands like ‚ÄúCome here‚Äù or follow specific gestures from its user.
  
- **Add Randomness to Behavior**:  
  To make the robot behave more like a **real dog**, I plan to introduce **randomness** into its actions, making its movements less predictable at times. This will create a more **organic and natural interaction** with the user, as it will mimic the spontaneity often found in pets.

- **Object Recognition**:  
  The robot will be able to **recognize specific objects** such as **cats and flowers** and respond accordingly. For example, it could **stop near flowers** or **avoid cats**, adding a level of interaction and intelligence that mimics natural behavior.
